"""Methods for dynamically adding decorators to all the methods and
classes within a module. The entries created by the decorators have been
pre-compressed for clarity and file size. Thus the short key names mean the
following:

.. code-block:: ini

    m = method
    a = args
    r = returns
    s = start
    e = elapsed
    x = analysis
    c = code

Examples:

Decorate a new package using the acorn decorator machinery.

>>> from acorn.logging.decoration import decorate
>>> import package
>>> decorate(package)

The decorate routine replaces all the members of the package with decorated ones
and does this recursively until the whole package is decorated. We can also use
the automatic decoration machinery with `acorn`. Open the `acorn.cfg` file and
add the name of the package to `[acorn.packages]`:

.. code-block:: ini

    package=1

Then, you can auto-decorate the package using:

.. code-block:: python

    that were decorated in the context of a *different* package still get
    redirected to the decorated objects.

    Args:
        package: package object to examine for compliance.

    Examples:
    When `scipy` is imported, it imports most of `numpy` automatically and then
    has references to the original, *undecorated* `numpy` functions. We use
    :func:`postfix` to set the `scipy` references to the decorated `numpy`
    functions.

    >>> import scipy
    >>> import acorn.numpy
    >>> from acorn.logging.decoration import postfix, decorate
    >>> decorate(scipy)
    >>> postfix(scipy)

    When we call :func:`decorate` on `scipy`, the references to `numpy`
    functions are ignored, because they don't belong to the `scipy`
    package. This filtering is a feature to prevent `acorn` repeatedly visiting
    commonly used modules that are imported.
